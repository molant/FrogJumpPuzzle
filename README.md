Our main aim of this website, was to develop a gaming puzzle that would interest all groups of people.

It was a challenge to avoid being too flashy so that we keep to the 10KB limit and still keep users interested through the whole experience.



This works even when the client side Javascript is disabled.



Below is the description of what the game is all about:

3 frogs are placed on 3 successive rocks on the left and 3 toads occupy 3 rightmost rocks.

On the whole, there are (3 + 3 + 1) rocks, so that just one rock remains unoccupied each time.



Frogs only move rightward; toads move leftward. Every move is either a Slide to the nearby rock or a Jump over one position, which is allowed only if the latter is occupied by a fellow of a different kind. In any case, no 2 animals are allowed in the same rock.



The goal is to move toads into 3 leftmost rocks and the frogs into 3 rightmost rocks.
